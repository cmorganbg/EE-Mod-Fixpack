~ SOLVED_JOURNAL #65062 // ~Dealing With Gromnir

I managed to get into the castle, finally, and encountered the mad General.
Whatever chance there might have been for a peaceful resolution was dashed as soon as I met Gromnir...he was obviously as mad as Melissan claimed.
Regardless, he is dead now and his tyranny and his rampaging men will no longer be a problem for Saradush.
There is, of course, still the problem of Yaga-Shura's army around the city...~ EXIT
