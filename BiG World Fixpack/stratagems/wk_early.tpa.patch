Perhaps it was because of the power he gathered from the Tree of Life, or because Bodhi was undead. Regardless, Irenicus has fallen, dragging both my soul and myself inexorably behind.  I am now alone in what must be the Nine Hells, but I am certain Irenicus is here somewhere... and somehow, in this, I must find the mage and battle him once and for all to get my soul back.
