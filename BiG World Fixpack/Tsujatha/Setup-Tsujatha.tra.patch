 @30   = ~Tsujatha Melalor and Lady <CHARNAME> celebrated their nuptials anew when they returned to Amn.  Together they became the mightiest heroes of their age; even without the blood of Bhaal in <CHARNAME>'s veins, none could stand before their combined power.  They destroyed evil wherever they found it, and they dwelt in bliss for many years.  Their eldest daughter was the paladin who struck the tyranny of the Cowled Wizards from Amn, and they lived to see it.  At last, however, one of their many enemies successfully struck at <CHARNAME>.  The poison of the wound in her heart was drawn out by Tsujatha's own lips, and she survived.  Tsujatha was not so fortunate.  Before he died, however, <CHARNAME> took him in her arms, and they vanished from Toril.  Some claim they went to Arvanaith, others that they went to the Outer Planes.  Their daughter maintained that they returned to Gilalion so that her father could die on the soil of his birth.  Whatever the truth might be, neither <CHARNAME> nor Tsujatha were ever seen again.~
