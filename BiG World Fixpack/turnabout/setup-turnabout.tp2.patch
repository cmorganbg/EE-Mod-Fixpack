 Alianna resumed her responsibilities as a Deathstalker, acting as assassin to the expediency of Thayvian politics and the Tower's coffers. This cocoon harbored your mother safely within her past for nearly a year before being slashed open to reveal the true host of the faithful's power: Cyric. Others of the Tower's priesthood accepted the brand of their new lord without hesitation, marking that the Mad God granted their spells already and must be appeased. Alianna resisted, unable to overlook Cyric's part in Bhaal's demise. She argued vocally against the usurper, her protests falling on deaf ears as the Tower unfurled flags proclaiming its allegiance to the Black Sun. As their first order of worship, the denizens of the tower turned their bloodlust against Alianna. Stripped of her divine magic and targeted as a heretic, Alianna could not escape, once again victim of her devotion to Bhaal, Lord of Murder.~

-  REPLACE ~99999~ ~Alianna did not adjust easily to her new life in the Realms. The first months, she remained close by <CHARNAME>'s side, cautious of any threats, often speaking of her obligation for his role in her resurrection. The relationship remained awkward, in part due to Alianna's sudden and inexplicable violent outbursts. She would become a woman possessed, screaming incoherently one moment, then lapsing into grief-stricken tears or, more frequently, a stark state of withdrawal. Aerie expressed her concern, questioning the safety of your young family while making sure to maintain as much distance between Alianna and little Quayle as possible. Alianna's deliverance from her demons came by chance: caught in a sudden squall and scrambling for gear, she offered Aerie assistance in moving Quayle to shelter. Holding her grandchild for the first time, Alianna transformed, thawing her deathly glare into a bemused smile. Thus began a period of discovery for both <CHARNAME and his mother. As Quayle developed, Alianna delighted at his first steps, then his first words. Her pride and affection for <CHARNAME>'s son was apparent, but in unguarded moments, he could detect the ghost of wistful regret hiding behind his mother's smile. Months of harmony grew into years, until, just before Quayle's fourth birthday, <CHARNAME>'s peaceful household shattered. One day, the hour growing late, Aerie went in search of her son and his grandmother. Curiosity transformed to horror as Aerie found Alianna dissecting the wings of a freshly captured dove to answer young Quayle's  innocent question about the flight of birds.

 The rift was irreparable, the damage done. Aerie gathered her son and fled, sending word for <CHARNAME> to follow--but only alone. <CHARNAME>'s mother would never see her grandson again. Grieving at her loss and crippled to understand the nature of her crime, Alianna began to wander the Realms. She joined random skirmishes with careless abandon, rarely bothering to choose sides. Gradually, Alianna shifted into the mercenary trade, meeting with fair success since she lacked few scruples among causes. For Alianna's final mission, she was hired to protect a small town on the Tethyr-Amnish border plagued with fever and bandit raids. The bandits proved the easier scourge to dispatch. Alianna found herself in a village of the dying, the disease indiscriminate of the age or status of its victims. She strained to remember prayers from her childhood, the abandoned litanies of healing long ago eclipsed by a life of murder and destruction. Alianna tended the sick, witnessing the struggle for survival purged of violence with new eyes.
 As each day passed, the plague's casualties mounted. The shape of her prayers began to change, as she shed her angry words cursing the weak, replacing them with entreaties for the strength to nurse those who suffered through another night. To her amazement and gratitude, Alianna's prayers were answered, and she persevered, the tide of recovery slowly shifting in the bedridden's favor. In the aftermath, Alianna learned compassion consoling the survivors of the fever and discovered humility in the back-breaking work of burying the dead. Taking responsibility for the children orphaned in the epidemic, the town became Alianna's adopted home. She established a hospice to care for the infirm and elderly, her faith finding shelter in the teachings of Ilmater, whom she credited with delivering her through her endless hours caring for the diseased. Many years later, <CHARNAME> would seek out Alianna, finding her hair grayed, her back stooped, and her featured lined with the progress of the clock. Reportedly, she said to him, "I confess, I did not believe we were meant for living to this ripe age. But, then, I only knew how to squander life. It took time for me to learn how to savor it."~
