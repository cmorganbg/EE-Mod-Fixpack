 @11096 = ~[C-AW01TL] Look. You seem to have plenty going on as it is. My employers are not likey to hire someone who causes trouble. Like being involved with mages blowing the crap out of the Promenade. You pobably should look elsewhere for work.~
 @11097 = ~[C-AW01TL] For now, yes. And with all the movement, there will be plenty of accounts to manage and enough to keep me going for quite some time. But these things are cyclical. Eventually, I am going to be sitting here keeping dozens of out of work mercenaries entertained and occupied, so that they don't tear half of Amn apart out of sheer boredom and cussedness.~
-@11098 = ~[C-AW01TL] Supply and demand, m'<PRO_BOYGIRL>, supply and demand. It is great to have strong demand, but when it outstrips supply, I end up on the pointy end of the spear. So far, that last has been only a figure of speech, because I don't subcontract Chill work. Best decision of my life.~

 @11100 = ~[C-AW01TL] Friend, the less you know the better. I know they have a tight grip on magic use, and getting permits from them is worse than trying to get blood from a stone. They don't like me much. The feeling is mutual.~
 @11101 = ~[C-AW01TL] Well, suit yourself. I am not planning on going anywhere, so I will keep a spot warm for you.~
