Cannot find "WeiDU.exe" in the current directory.
The BiG World Fixpack contains an optional component which requires
the WeiDU.exe. It will be skipped if you choose to continue the installation.
Close this window now and place a WeiDU.exe in the current directory,
if you want to run the optional component.
